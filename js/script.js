   Add your global variables that store the DOM elements you will 
   need to reference and/or manipulate. 
   
   But be mindful of which variables should be global and which 
   should be locally scoped to one of the two main functions you're 
   going to create. A good general rule of thumb is if the variable 
   will only be used inside of a function, then it can be locally 
   scoped to that function.
***/
const student = // this will store the student list item elements in student list
const item = // this will store the number of items on a page



/*** 
   Create the `showPage` function to hide all of the items in the 
   list except for the ten you want to show.

   Pro Tips: 
     - Keep in mind that with a list of 54 students, the last page 
       will only display four.
     - Remember that the first student has an index of 0.
     - Remember that a function `parameter` goes in the parens when 
       you initially define the function, and it acts as a variable 
       or a placeholder to represent the actual function `argument` 
       that will be passed into the parens later when you call or 
       "invoke" the function 
***/

const showPage = (list, page) => { 
   if (index of item is >= index of first.child)
   show item on page && show item <= index of lastChild on page
}// we want to hide all students except for 10
// loop over items in the LIST parameter and if it is >= the index of the first




const appendPageLinks = (list) => { // creates and appends funcitoning pagination links
   total items / max number per page = total pages 
   create.element = div and set className to pagination 
   append to div 
   for (every page add links to other pages)
   use event.target to go to different pages when they are clicked

   // below is an example from the practice session showing how to embed for loop and conditional in function, will probably need to be tailored 
   
// const sectionSelection = (list, section) => {
//    const startIndex = (section * perPage) - perPage;
//    const endIndex = (section * perPage) - 1;
//      for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i ++) {
//        list[i].style.color = 'whitesmoke';
//      }
//      for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i ++) {
//        if (i >= startIndex && i <= endIndex) {
//          list[i].style.color = "green";
//        }
     }
 }
